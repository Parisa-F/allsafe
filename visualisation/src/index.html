    <h1>Which one is more crucial: Higher number of reports or higher money lost?</h1>
    <h1>The answer is BOTH!</h1>

    <section id="scam-reports-money-section">
        <h2>Does the money lost follow a similar pattern as the number of reports?</h2>

        <div id="money-bar-chart" class = "chart"></div>
        <p>While the top 5 most frequent scams align with the top 5 scams causing the most financial loss, their patterns have some differences.<br>
            In 2024, the top 5 scams alone accounted for approximately AUD 31,245,435 in losses, representing about 96% of the total amount lost on social media scams with young adults. 
            Among these, investment scams have the highest financial impact, making up 60% of the total losses, followed by dating and romance scams, which account for around 20%.<br>
            The different patterns from the number of reports and money loss indicate that no matter which type of scam you are facing, the potential loss can accumulate into a vast amount and continuously influence our daily lives.<br><br>
