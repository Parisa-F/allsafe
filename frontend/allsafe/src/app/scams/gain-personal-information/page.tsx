                        Mary received an SMS to say her mobile number was being
                        ported to a different network provider. She contacted
                        her mobile provider to find out why. She immediately
                        realised what was going on and phoned her bank. While on
                        the phone, she tried logging in to her internet banking,
                        but to no avail. As she was talking to the bank, she
                        started receiving e-mails about her personal details
                        being changed and the PIN to the credit card was being
                        changed. She had ordered a credit card a month earlier
                        but had not received it. The bank started blocking my
                        accounts and cards. However, the fraudsters have stolen
                        her identity to create a new mobile account at the
                        different network provider, hacked her internet banking
                        account, and stolen funds.
