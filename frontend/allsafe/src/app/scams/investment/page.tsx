                            Lily was called by an online trader who specialised
                            in binary options and cryptocurrency. He said his
                            company used the latest technology and offered
                            guaranteed returns. Lily invested a few thousand
                            dollars on the company&apos;s online platform. She
                            could see good profits and continued to invest at
                            their insistence. When she wanted to withdraw some
                            money she was told she would need to pay taxes on
                            the profits. When she continued asking for her
                            money, her trades started to fail and her profits
                            fall. She faced continuous pressure to keep
                            investing otherwise she would lose everything.
                            Eventually Lily got back 3% of her initial
                            investment but had realised it was a scam.
