                        A Brisbane man used two aliases to arrange an elaborate
                        online job scam through various companies to steal the
                        identities of 52 taxpayers. He lodged 62 fraudulent
                        income tax returns and attempted to obtain over $565,000
                        in refunds. After conducting fake interviews over the
                        phone the fraudster would email applicants to confirm
                        they had been successful in their application for the
                        job. He would also request a scanned copy of their
                        driver&apos;s license, bank account details, tax file
                        number and shirt size. He used this information to
                        fraudulently create myGov accounts. If they already had
                        an account he used the information to take over their
                        account and change the details as required. He would
                        then link the myGov accounts to Australian Taxation
                        Office&apos;s online services where he would lodge false
                        income tax returns in their names. The man was charged
                        with 106 offences and was sentenced to 5 years in
                        prison.
