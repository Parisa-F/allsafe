                        Dating and romance scam – Dan lost $20,000

                    Dan was contacted by a person on Facebook who claimed to be
                    a US military officer in Afghanistan. After Dan was
                    persuaded to send iTunes cards, the person told him he would
                    come and see him and marry him. Soon after the officer was
                    delayed for another “special mission”. Excuse after excuse
                    followed as to why the officer could not visit. He also had
                    gold he wanted to send back (for some reason) but it was
                    seized and then the officer was jailed and needed $8000 to
                    get out.
