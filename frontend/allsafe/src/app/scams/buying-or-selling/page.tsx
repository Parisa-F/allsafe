                            A clever website advertised cheap BBQs. Payment was
                            required via credit card with a 2.99% fee, or direct
                            transfer with a 5% discount. Then Sarah received an
                            email saying that due to logistic emails, her order
                            was cancelled and the money was being refunded. The
                            money has not been refunded.

                                this payment method, and charged a higher fee
